I am a highly proficient and results-driven Senior Frontend Developer with over a decade of experience in the software industry. My journey has evolved from building standard web interfaces to architecting robust, scalable, and high-performance enterprise ecosystems.

My passion lies in solving complex UI/UX challenges, driving technological adoption, and automating the entire frontend lifecycle. I pride myself on bridging the gap between complex backend logic and seamless user experiences.

## My Approach to Frontend Engineering

> *"Modern frontend development is not just about painting pixels; it is about creating sustainable architectures that empower teams and delight users."*

My work focuses on three core pillars of modern web development:

* **Strategic Modernization:** I specialize in breathing new life into legacy systems. My experience leading the massive migration of Mastercard Connect from Angular to React demonstrates my ability to handle complex state management transitions and architectural shifts without disrupting business continuity.
* **Developer Experience (DX) & Standardization:** I believe that a consistent UI requires a consistent codebase. By building centralized component libraries (Design Systems) and white-label solutions, I reduce code duplication and accelerate feature delivery for cross-functional teams.
* **Quality Assurance Automation:** I advocate for a "shift-left" testing mentality. Integrating tools like Playwright and Docker into the CI/CD pipeline ensures that performance regressions and accessibility issues are caught long before they reach production.
